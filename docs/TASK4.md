# Task 4 Log

## What the task requires
- Initialize repo & push to GitHub
- Create main, dev, and feature branches
- Use PRs to merge
- Add README
- Use .gitignore and tags
- Document tasks in markdown

## What I did
- Created repo with `main`, opened `dev`, then a `feature/*` branch
- Committed changes with clear messages
- Opened PR from feature → dev; then dev → main
- Created annotated tag `v1.0.0`

## Notes
- `.gitignore` ignores common DevOps clutter
- Tags mark release points
- See `docs/Q&A.md` for interview answers
